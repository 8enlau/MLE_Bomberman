First idea:
We need a good dataset. The best dataset is the one consisting of the information the player gets in each step.
So lets create a dataset by playing the game and saving each step of it. This is also a great way to learn, how the program works.
So I copied the code, deleted most GUI stuff, because its not needed and added a function to save the games.
